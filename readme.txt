OOP control work 2018
Developed by Kyrylo Vasylenko, CSIT-2

TASK 1

Create the most effective (the one that creates the minimum amount of additional objects) representation of Triangle with the help of its points and (or) segments. Keep track of objects. Create a function to construct a Triangle's median with the following signature: const Segment& Triangle::median(const Segment& side) const

Signature was changed from const Segment& Triangle::median(const Segment& side) const
to const Segment& median(const SidePtr) const
for using median method for any side of triangle.

TASKS 2 and 3

Create class Calendar, which provides the functionality to determine day of the week by its date.

Add national celebrations' dates to Calendar.

My comment: I just added holidays from 2018 year without counting easter and etc.

TASKS 4 and 5

Create class Alarm to signal on a particular day and time.

Make it possible to cancel alarm or repeat it if it's not cancelled during a particular period defined in class.

TASK 6

Make it possible to create an Alarm, which will signal every workday (excluding celebrations).

My comment: 
For testing of this tasks I used std::thread,
because good solution is turn off alarm from other thread, 
while he is working in main thread

Yes, I could did it without std::thread, but I think that solution without thread - not beautiful
(asking user between signals should timer make signal again or not and stop him, if not)


TASK 7

Create parameterized class Pair, which will contain Key and Value.

TASK 8

Priority Stack is a stack, which contains Pairs. Create class QuickPushPriorityStack in such a way that operation void push(const Pair&) has O(1) complexity. The last added element with highest (lowest) priority is popped.

My comment:

The complexity of push operation is O(1).

The complexity of push operation is O(n), where n - stack size.

TASK 9

Create class QuickTopPriorityStack in such a way that operations Value top() const Ñ– void pop() have O(1) complexity.

My comment: Top and pop operations have complexity O(1) because the elements are stored in the sequence in the correct order, and we need to take the last element for top or cut the sequence for pop. That is, to perform these operations, we have to either access the cell of the array, or decrement a variable (_size), the complexity of both is O(1)*. * the size of the array changes from time to time

Then for the push operation, we have to find the desired index to insert a new item. The index is searched from the end of the sequence to the beginning. In the worst case, the desired element is in the beginning of the sequence, so the complexity is O(N), where N is the number the elements in the stack.

TASK 10

Create mutual interface for classes from tasks 8 and 9.

My comment: 
linkedPriorityStack.h
For tasks 8-10 I used NVI architecture
For stack I used Node instead array, because I think, that array has too much excess implementation for using him in stack.
